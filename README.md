## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This project is part of my Nanonegree in Data Science on Udacity. I had the goal to answer three question regarding a data set from Airbnb in Seattle:

1) Which selected variables from the data set impact the price per night of the Airbnb listings in Seattle?
2) Is the price per night of an Airbnb appartment the more affordable the more people share an appartment per night?
3) Is there a seasonality in the prices?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
calendar.csv --> data about date, listing id and price per night
listings.csv --> data about each listing
reviews.csv --> data about reviews of each listing (not used in the analysis until now)
main.ipynb --> Jupyter Notebook used for analysis

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The results can be found on the blog medium via this link: https://medium.com/p/88eaa27a8d71. All graphics can be found in the data main.ipynb.
